# Signal processing

## Repository description

This repository contains code related to the Signal Processing course by Mike X. Cohen on Udemy:

[Complete neural signal processing and analysis: Zero to hero](https://www.udemy.com/course/solved-challenges-ants/)

The majority of the "base" code is adapted from material developed by the course instructor. I have made minor modifications to experiment with it. The "problemset" files contain more of my own contributions, where I added creative input beyond the provided material.
